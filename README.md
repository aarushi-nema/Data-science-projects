A collection of all my data science projects

1. Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing
In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives. In this python project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected.

2. Rise and Fall of Programming Languages
How can we tell what programming languages and technologies are used by the most people? How about what languages are growing and which are shrinking, so that we can tell which are most worth investing time in?
One excellent source of data is Stack Overflow, a programming question and answer site with more than 16 million questions on programming topics. By measuring the number of questions about each technology, we can get an approximate sense of how many people are using it. We're going to use open data from the Stack Exchange Data Explorer to examine the relative popularity of languages like R, Python, Java and Javascript have changed over time.

3. [PySpark] Orders data cleaning
As a Data Engineer at an electronics e-commerce company, Voltmart, you have been requested by a peer Machine Learning team to clean the data containing the information about orders made last year. They are planning to further use this cleaned data to build a demand forecasting model. To achieve this, they have shared their requirements regarding the desired output table format.
